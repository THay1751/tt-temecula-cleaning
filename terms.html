          <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
          <p class="muted">Last updated: January 2025</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <p class="muted">
            By requesting or using services from T &amp; T Temecula Cleaning Services, you agree to the terms below.
            If you have questions, contact us before scheduling.
          </p>

          <div class="hr"></div>

          <h3>1. Service Requests and Estimates</h3>
          <p class="muted">
            All bookings and quote requests are requests only and are subject to confirmation. Any online or phone estimate
            is a range based on the information provided. The final quote is confirmed before service based on the actual
            condition of the home, size, access, scope, and requested add-ons.
          </p>

          <h3>2. Access, Safety, and Preparation</h3>
          <p class="muted">
            Clients are responsible for providing safe access to the property (entry instructions, gate codes, parking, etc.).
            Pets should be secured, and valuables or fragile items should be put away prior to service. We may decline or stop
            service if conditions are unsafe (aggressive pets, hazardous materials, unsafe floors, etc.).
          </p>

          <h3>3. Scope of Work</h3>
          <p class="muted">
            Services are performed according to the selected package and any agreed add-ons. Results may vary depending on
            buildup, wear, staining, and prior maintenance. Some issues require specialized remediation outside standard cleaning.
          </p>

          <h3>4. Satisfaction Guarantee</h3>
          <p class="muted">
            If something is missed or needs attention, notify us within 24 hours of service completion. When appropriate, we’ll
            schedule a reasonable touch-up. This guarantee does not apply to pre-existing damage, permanent stains, or normal wear.
          </p>

          <h3>5. Cancellations and Rescheduling</h3>
          <p class="muted">
            Please provide reasonable notice for cancellations or rescheduling. Same-day cancellations may be subject to a fee,
            especially if a team has already been dispatched or a time slot was reserved.
          </p>

          <h3>6. Payments</h3>
          <p class="muted">
            Payment terms (method and timing) are confirmed during scheduling. If additional time or scope is required beyond the
            original request, we will communicate changes before proceeding.
          </p>

          <h3>7. Liability and Limitations</h3>
          <p class="muted">
            We are not responsible for pre-existing damage, loose fixtures, normal wear and tear, or items not disclosed prior to service.
            Clients agree to disclose any areas needing special handling (delicate surfaces, fragile items, known issues) before service begins.
          </p>

          <h3>8. Photos and Documentation</h3>
          <p class="muted">
            We may take before/after photos of work areas for quality control and documentation. Photos are focused on cleaned surfaces,
            not personal items. If you prefer no photos, notify us in writing before service.
          </p>

          <h3>9. Contact</h3>
          <p class="muted">
            Questions about these terms can be sent to
